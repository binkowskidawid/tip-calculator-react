# 👨🏻‍💻🧮 Simple tip calculator from frontend mentor 🧮👨🏻‍💻

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. To styling I used [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This will install all the necessary dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
